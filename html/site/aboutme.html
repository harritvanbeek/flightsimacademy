                            <p>
                                As a child I was already interested in automation (Computers). I was 25 years old when I created my first web page with HTML and CSS. During my studies at the LOI. Over the years I have immersed myself in PHP, which resulted in my own company where I created a complete web application called "request server", and now with this website, a completely PHP, AngularJS application, which again works together from finally my Flight Simulator.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                I'm the type a guy who loves a challenge when it comes to IT an how to take it forward. There are no technical (IT) problems, only solutions not yet found. As a team we can find those solutions, if we combine knowledge and ideas of the individual team members with an open mind. We only need the motivation and the will to succeed. I'm that guy. I'm willing to learn from the knowledge and ideas of others and contribute with my own. I'm a warm, social, compassioned person, a true teamplayer.
